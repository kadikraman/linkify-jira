# Linkify JIRA

All links in JIRA open in the same window. Why? Who knows. There's been [issues](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-9380) [raised](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-70096) from users wishing that there was at least an OPTION for EXTERNAL links could be opened in a new tab, but no dice.

So Chrome extension it is. This one will open ALL links in a new tab. Issues, confluence pages, actual external links, the lot. Take it or leave it!

## Installation

1. clone or download this repo
2. open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
3. drag and the project folder into the extensions list
