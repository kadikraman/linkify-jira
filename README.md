# Linkify JIRA

All links in JIRA open in the same window. Why? Who knows, really. There's been [issues](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-9380) [raised](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-70096) from users wishing that there was at least an __option__ for __external__ links could be opened in a new tab, but so far no dice from JIRA.

So Chrome extension it is! This one will open ALL links in a new tab. Issues, confluence pages, actual external links, the lot.

## Installation

1. clone or download this repo
2. open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
3. drag and the project folder into the extensions list
4. refresh your browser
